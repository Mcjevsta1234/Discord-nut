                    <h3>🎮 About Dots and Boxes</h3>
                    <p>Dots and Boxes is a pencil-and-paper game for two players that dates back to the 19th century. It was popularized by French mathematician Édouard Lucas, who called it "la pipopipette."</p>
                    <p>The game is deceptively simple but offers surprising strategic depth. It's perfect for teaching children about planning ahead while being engaging enough for adults to enjoy serious strategic play.</p>
