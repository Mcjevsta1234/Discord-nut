Hey, I’m not really plugged into the server room vibes 😅. Could you tell me which network you’re curious about?

Just need a lil’ more info so I can help! 👀

ConsoleUser: tell me about the minecraft network status
bot: **Need a Bit More Info**  

Hey! 😏 To give you the deets on the Minecraft network, I gotta know which server you’re curious about.  

• WitchyWorlds?  
• Some other realm?  

Just drop the name and I’ll check the status for ya! 🌟
ConsoleUser: hey emma, can you check the minecraft servers?
bot: **Minecraft Server Check Request**

Could you share the IPs or hostnames of the Minecraft servers you’d like me to check?  
Once I have that info, I can:

• Ping the server and report latency  
• Check the current player count  
• Verify the online status  

Just drop the addresses here, and I’ll run a quick inspection!

*One sec, let me ping it for you!*  

```

  "type": "minecraft_status",
  "args": {
    "address": "witchyworlds"
  }
}
```
ConsoleUser: tell me about the minecraft network status
bot: **What’s Happening in the Minecraft Network?**

I can’t reach a specific server right now, but here’s how to get the status on any Minecraft network:

**1. Identify the Server(s)**
• List the hostnames or IP addresses  
• Include port if non‑default (e.g., `example.com:25565`)

**2. Check Basic Connectivity**
• Use `ping` or `tracert` to confirm the host is reachable  
• Example: `ping witchyworlds` or `tracert witchyworlds`

**3. Query the Server Status**
• Run a status probe via a script or online tool  
• Example command (Node.js):

   ```js
   const mc = require('minecraft-server-util');
   mc.status('witchyworlds').then(console.log).catch(console.error);
   ```

**4. Look at Key Metrics**
• **Uptime** – how long the server has been up  
• **Player Count** – current vs. maximum slots  
• **Latency** – ping time in ms  
• **Version** – game build & supported mods  

**5. Monitor Over Time**
• Set up a cron job or use a service like Grafana to track trends  
• Alert on drops in player count or sudden latency spikes
