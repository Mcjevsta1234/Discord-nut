what_the_noodles: Emma you good
bot: Hey what_the_noodles! 😄 Spill the tea, what's got you checking in? Everything's golden on my end - just living that social media queen life, you know how it is! 💅✨ How's your world looking today?
what_the_noodles: Emma code me a minecraft hosting website, with a console mock with working minecraft commands, and a react modern ui
bot: **Minecraft Hosting Site – Quick Starter Kit**

**What you’ll get**
- **React UI** – modern, responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
- **Node/Express backend** – handles server spin‑up requests
- **Mock console** – runs a few real‑world Minecraft commands (`/status`, `/stop`, `/list`)
- **Docker setup** – optional one‑liner to launch a vanilla MC server

---

**1️⃣ Project Structure**

```
my-mc-host/
├─ client/            # React app

│  │  ├─ components/
│  │  │  ├─ Console.jsx

│  └─ mcCommands.js
├─ docker/
│  └─ Dockerfile      # vanilla MC server
└─ README.md
```

---

**2️⃣ Core Files (snippets)**  

**`client/src/components/Console.jsx`** – mock terminal UI  

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Console() {
  const [log, setLog] = useState([]);
  const [cmd, setCmd] = useState("");

  const run = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/command", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ command: cmd }),
    });
    const { output } = await res.json();
    setLog([...log, `> ${cmd}`, output]);
    setCmd("");
  };

  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-900 text-green-400 p-4 rounded">
      {log.map((l, i) => (
        <div key={i}>{l}</div>
      ))}
      <input
        className="w-full bg-transparent outline-none"
        value={cmd}
        onChange={(e) => setCmd(e.target.value)}
        onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === "Enter" && run()}
        placeholder="type a command..."
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**`server/mcCommands.js`** – minimal command parser  

```js
const exec = require("child_process").exec;

const handlers = {
  status: () => "🟢 Server is online",
  stop: () => {
    exec("docker stop mc-server", () => {});
    return "🛑 Stopping server...";
  },
  list: () => "👥 Players: Steve, Alex",
};

module.exports = (cmd) => {
  const key = cmd.trim().replace("/", "").split(" ")[0];
  return handlers[key] ? handlers[key]() : `❓ Unknown command: ${cmd}`;
};
```

**`server/index.js`** – API endpoint  

```js
const express = require("express");
const handleCmd = require("./mcCommands");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.post("/api/command", (req, res) => {
  const { command } = req.body;
  const output = handleCmd(command);
  res.json({ output });
});

app.listen(4000, () => console.log("API running on :4000"));
```

---

**3️⃣ Quick Setup**

1. **Clone & install**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd my-mc-host
   npm install          # root (install both client & server)
   ```

2. **Start backend**  
   ```bash
   node server/index.js
   ```

3. **Start React UI**  
   ```bash
   cd client && npm start
   ```

4. **Optional MC server** (Docker)  
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker build -t mc-server .
   docker run -d -p 25565:25565 --name mc-server mc-server
   ```

---

**4️⃣ Next Steps (you decide)**  
- Add auth (JWT) for user‑specific server control  
- Expand `mcCommands.js` to call the real Minecraft RCON API  
- Polish UI with charts for CPU/RAM usage (Chart.js)  

---
